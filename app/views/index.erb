				A Bluegrey Carpetshark wriggled it's way across the base, coming right up to the glass before making a sharp turn to the right.<br>
				It wasn't a particularly interesting shark. Still, it was the only shark that had bothered to come up and say hello. Craig sidestepped over to the far wall to read the information about the Bluegrey Carpetshark.

				Sounds familiar, Craig thought. Takes one to know one.<br>
				He kicked the bottom of the tank suddenly, thoughts of 1999 poured in from all around.<br>
				It wasn't as if he was a 'bottom-dweller', number 2 in the Official UK Charts is certainly not bottom-dwelling. <br>

					Craig took deep and steadying breathes to calm himself.<br>
					He stared back into the aquatic tank and muttered his secret mantra to himself under his breath. <br>

		Craig pressed his hands against the glass of the tank and raised his eyes to the surface. A great Hammerhead shark haloed darkly up above. His therapist had said it was important to remember one's achievements, but equally important not to live in the past. Craig had never properly considered that not only was the hammerhead shark's head the shape of a hammer, but that it's flesh was the colour of dull metal, as if it's body had been used.

		Craig moved over to a tank of jellyfish, watching them undulate he was glad there was a sheet of high strength acrylic plastic between them. His hands were itching to plunge themselves into the brightly coloured domes and frills. This impulse tasted like the sweet pain of childhood.

		Craig took out his iphone and scrolled through his artists hovering over his on name. He selected a song and let it play out as he watched the creatures expand and contract.<br>

		<p class="calm-SIX">Jellyfish have been expanding and contracting for over 500 million years, Craig thought. Craig wondered how many times 7-days could play in 500 million years.
